# Electronics for Beginners Solution Guide

This repository is just to hold the PDF for the "Electronics for Beginners" Solution Guide.  
Note that this guide is a work-in-progress.
Not only are there questions without answers, it is likely that at least some of the answers contain mistakes.
Please open issues with any mistakes that you see.

This guide is neither public domain nor copyleft.
You can distribute it but not publish it.
Once it is complete, it will probably move somewhere else, or get pulled in favor of a physical volume.
Once it is gone from here, you are still free to distribute electronically drafts that you have previously downloaded.

Basically, the idea is that you can share with friends, but you can't share commercially, and don't expect the final draft to be posted here.
